# Flask Hello World

A simple Flask app for demonstration purposes, deployable with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
- [Minikube (for local Kubernetes)](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Run the App Locally with Docker

You can run the app in a Docker container by following these steps:

1. **Build the Docker Image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t flask-hello-world .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-hello-world
   ```

3. **Access the App**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`

### 2. Deploy on Kubernetes

To deploy the app on a Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

1. **Set up a Local Kubernetes Cluster (Optional)**
   - Start a local cluster using Minikube (skip if deploying on a cloud-managed Kubernetes service like GKE, EKS, or AKS).
     ```bash
     minikube start
     ```

2. **Apply Kubernetes Configuration Files**
   - The Kubernetes configuration files, typically named `deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml`, will create a Deployment and Service to run and expose the app.
   - Run the following commands to deploy:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
     kubectl apply -f service.yaml
     ```

3. **Access the Application**
   - If using Minikube, access the service with:
     ```bash
     minikube service <service-name>
     ```
   - For cloud-managed clusters, check the external IP:
     ```bash
     kubectl get services
     ```

### 3. Provision Infrastructure with Terraform

To provision infrastructure on a cloud provider (like AWS, GCP, or Azure) using Terraform, do the following:

1. **Initialize Terraform**
   - In the directory containing the Terraform files, run:
     ```bash
     terraform init
     ```

2. **Apply the Terraform Configuration**
   - Apply the configurations to create infrastructure resources.
     ```bash
     terraform apply
     ```
   - Confirm any prompts with `yes`.

3. **Verify Infrastructure**
   - Terraform will output the created resources. If the setup includes a Kubernetes cluster, you can connect your `kubectl` to the cluster and deploy the app following the steps in the Kubernetes section above.

## Cleaning Up

- **Docker**: Stop the container by pressing `CTRL+C` in the terminal where it's running or using:
  ```bash
  docker ps  # Find the container ID
  docker stop <container-id>
  ```
- **Kubernetes**: Delete the resources with:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml
  kubectl delete -f service.yaml
  ```
- **Terraform**: Tear down infrastructure with:
  ```bash
  terraform destroy
  ```
